**Repository Description:**

This repository houses the Solito Monorepo, a cross-platform solution built using React Native and Next.js. This test project seamlessly integrates both frameworks, allowing for efficient development and deployment across various platforms. Explore the codebase to discover a unified and scalable approach to building applications for both mobile (_React Native_) and web (_Next.js_). This monorepo structure promotes code reusability, maintainability, and a streamlined development experience.

**Key Points:**

1. **Cross-Platform Development:** Utilizes the power of _React Native_ and _Next.js_ to create a unified solution for mobile and web platforms.
2. **Monorepo Architecture:** All project code and configurations are organized within a single repository for ease of maintenance and collaboration.
3. **Efficiency and Consistency:** Develop once, deploy anywhere. The monorepo ensures a consistent development experience and facilitates code reuse between platforms.
4. **Scalable Solution:** Built to accommodate the growth of the project, providing a foundation for scalable and extensible applications.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and leverage this monorepo for your cross-platform development needs!
